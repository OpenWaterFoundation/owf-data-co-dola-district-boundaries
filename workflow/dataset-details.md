## Overview ##

This dataset contains GeoJSON polygon features for Colorado Department of Local Affairs (DOLA) boundaries
that are relevant to water, including:

* fire protection districts
* metropolitan districts
* soil conservation districts
* water and sanitation districts

These are statewide layers that are intended to simplify use in applications and additional analysis.

Note that districts are entities that are separate from municipal service areas
and therefore these layers do not provide a complete picture of services.
Other datasets provide merged data, for example for treated water service.

## Update Frequency and Versions ##

The dataset is updated periodically from the State Department of Local Affairs Office and a single `latest` version is published.
In the future, dated snapshots may be published to help archive data to understand growth.
